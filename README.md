# Advent of Code Template

Advent of Code Template using Node JS for Current Year.

## Setup

If using the Advent of Code Template repo; click [**`Use this template`**](./generate) to set a new repository name, e.g.: `advent-of-code-20xx`.

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

If this a brand new repository, run: `node setup` to configure it for Current Year.

## Running

To run a solution by day, use:
```
npm start day1
````

## New solutions

To create a new solution, run:

```
npm run create day1
```

This will not overwrite existing solutions.

Populate `input.txt` with your solution input, and then start implementing your solution in the day's folder.

## Viewer

A local webserver has been provided to browse the solutions, and optionally create web based visualisations to go with the code.

To start the server run: `npm run webserver` - a new hardcoded index.html will be generated each time you browse the index.
